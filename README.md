# ShoesEccomerce
An eccomerce project with React, NodeJS e MongoDB


The following technologies were utilized
MongoDB: It is a NoSQL-based database. It is in charge of data storage exchange and execution, assisting Node.JS in running the server without issue.
ExpressJS: It is essentially a back-end web-based framework that allows you to build web apps by providing an easy-to-use interface.
ReactJS: The frontend library would be React. Redux would be used for state management. For the basic design of the interface, we would employ the React Bootstrap library.
NodeJS: It is, by definition, a JavaScript runtime that is built on the well-known Chrome’s V8 JS engine and is known for being lightweight and efficient due to its use of an event-driven and non-blocking input-output model.
